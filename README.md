# helloworld-openai-embeddings

The goal of this project is to create a question answering demo using OpenAI embeddings and a sample text.

I've created a file called [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) that breaks down the solution I choose.

## My current environment

* Windows 11 with WSL 2 (Ubuntu)
* Python  3.10.6
* Venv    3.10.6
* Pip     22.0.2

You should already have these dependencies installed.

This project is meant to run in Ubuntu or WSL 2.

## Setup

bash manage.sh install
