# RESULTS

I will track my results here.

## Try 1 - naive approach

I tried to compare the question embedding against the sentences embeddings and then find the closest match using cosine similarity.

Results: The results were bad.

Action: Use openai completion API to summarize the sentences.

## Try 2 - generate synthetic questions

I tried to generate synthetic questions and compared the embeddings of the synthetic questions against the question embeddings.

I tried different prompts.

Results: The results were bad.

Action: Create a neural network to select the best answer.

## Try 3 - neural network
