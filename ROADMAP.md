# Roadmap

## Step 1: Setup environment

Things to consider when making the project structure:

* The project should have isolated dependencies (I will use pip's `venv`)
* The project structure should be well organized
* The project should have a demo webpage
* The project should be easy to manage through the terminal
* We should have a private `.env` file so we don't leak OpenAI's API key
* Do not leak original sample text
